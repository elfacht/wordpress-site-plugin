## A standard WordPress plugin for custom functions

### About
Inspired by this idea of using a site-specific plugin instead the
functions.php of a WordPress theme:

This plugin comes with some basic functions to get things started more fasten.

### Usage

1. Install the site-plugins folder in wp-plugins
2. Activate the plugin
3. Add or remove functions in the plugin

See detailed description in this blog post (german): http://www.getoutofmyinternet.com/1947

### Important!

This plugin includes the standard setup functions of the WP standard themes (e.g. TwentyTwelve).
To avoid conflicts remove the functions.php in the theme folder.
